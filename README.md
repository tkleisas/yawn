## Features

### Audio Engine
- **Real-time Audio Engine** — Lock-free audio thread with PortAudio (ASIO/WASAPI/ALSA), zero audio-thread allocations. The AI wrote it without being able to hear audio. We're not sure if that's a superpower or a disability.
- **Clip Playback** — Audio files (WAV, FLAC, OGG, AIFF, MP3), looping, gain, fade-in/out
- **Quantized Launching** — Launch clips on beat or bar boundaries with configurable quantize resolution (Next Bar, Next Beat, Immediate, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16)
- **Transport** — Play/stop/record, BPM control, beat-synced position tracking, loop range with draggable markers
- **Metronome** — Synthesized click track with accent on downbeats, configurable volume & time signature, count-in (0/1/2/4 bars), mode selection (Always/Record Only/Play Only/Off)
- **Follow Actions** — 8 action types (Next, Previous, First, Last, Random, Any, Play Again, Stop), dual-action with probability (A/B chance), bar-count trigger duration
- **Time Stretching** — WSOLA (rhythmic/percussive) and Phase Vocoder (tonal/texture) algorithms, per-track speed ratio (0.25×–4×), 6 warp modes (Off/Auto/Beats/Tones/Texture/Repitch)

- **Warp Markers** — Map original audio positions to target beat positions for flexible time-stretching

### Mixer & Routing

- **Oscilloscope** — Real-time waveform visualizer (non-destructive analysis effect)
- **Spectrum Analyzer** — FFT-based frequency spectrum display (non-destructive analysis effect)

### VST3 Plugin Hosting

*The AI built a plugin host before learning what a plugin sounds like. It correctly implemented the entire VST3 COM interface on the first try. We're terrified.*

```

**Thread model:** UI thread (SDL main loop) + Audio thread (PortAudio callback). Communication is entirely via lock-free SPSC ring buffers — no mutexes or allocations on the audio thread. We asked the AI to explain lock-free programming and it wrote a 200-line ring buffer. We asked it again and it wrote a different 200-line ring buffer. Both passed tests. We don't ask questions anymore.

**Audio signal flow:**

### Phase 16: Arrangement View (Done)

The Arrangement View provides a linear timeline for composing full tracks:

- **Timeline grid** — Beat/bar grid with zoom (4–120 px/beat) and scroll, snap-to-grid with 6 resolution levels
- **Clip placement** — Select, move (same/cross-track), resize edges, double-click create, Ctrl+D duplicate, Delete remove
- **Arrangement playback** — Per-track audio + MIDI clip rendering with fade crossfades, thread-safe clip submission
- **Session/Arrangement toggle** — Per-track S/A button, independent mode switching, auto-activation on view switch
- **Automation lanes** — Expandable per-track lanes with breakpoint envelopes, visual curve rendering, click/drag/delete breakpoints
- **Loop range** — Green markers in ruler with drag handles, Shift+click to set, L key to toggle, wraps playback position
- **Auto-scroll** — Playhead follow mode (F key), keeps playhead visible during playback
- **Playhead** — Click ruler to seek, triangle indicator + vertical line, renders in real-time
- **Waveform display** — Audio clip waveform rendering in arrangement blocks

### Phase 17: Recording, MIDI Learn & Audio Export (Done)

Full recording and I/O capabilities:

- **Audio recording** — Per-track input recording with arm/disarm, overdub, stereo capture, monitor modes
- **MIDI recording** — Real-time note/CC capture from hardware keyboards with proper finalization
- **MIDI Learn** — Map any CC or Note to any parameter via right-click context menu, visual feedback during learn, JSON persistence
- **Audio export** — Offline render to WAV/FLAC/OGG with configurable bit depth and sample rate, export dialog with progress
- **Project serialization** — Full save/load to `.yawn` JSON format with sample management

### Phase 18: Session Management & Track Operations (Done)

Scene and track management for a complete workflow:

- **Scene management** — Insert, duplicate, delete scenes via right-click context menu with full undo support
- **Track deletion** — Delete tracks with confirmation dialog, engine array shifting across all sub-engines
- **Follow actions** — 8 action types with dual-action probability for clip chaining
- **Undo/redo** — Full undo/redo system with action merging (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y)
- **Time stretching** — WSOLA and Phase Vocoder algorithms for tempo-independent playback
- **Crash handling** — Signal handlers with stack traces for debugging

### Phase 19: VST3 Plugin Hosting

Full VST3 plugin support for third-party effects and instruments:

- **VST3 SDK integration** — Compile and link the official Steinberg VST3 SDK
- **Plugin scanning** — Discover VST3 plugins in standard system paths
- **Audio effects** — Load VST3 effects into track/return/master effect chains
- **Instruments** — Load VST3 instruments as MIDI track sound generators
- **Plugin editor windows** — Embed native plugin GUIs in secondary SDL3 windows
- **Parameter mapping** — Generic knob grid for plugins without custom GUIs
- **Preset management** — Save/load plugin state with project

## The Team

| Role | Entity | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| **Project Manager** | Tasos Kleisas | Vision, QA, yelling "it still doesn't work", changing requirements mid-sentence, clicking things really fast to find bugs, discovering that resonance + fast cutoff sweep = pain |
| **Chief Engineer** | Claude (Anthropic) | Writing code, rewriting code, explaining why the code was wrong, rewriting it again, apologizing, "I see the issue!", writing commit messages longer than the actual fix |

### Development Methodology

```
while (true) {
    PM: "Add feature X"
    AI: *writes 200 lines*
    PM: "It doesn't work"
    AI: "Ah, I see the issue!" *rewrites 200 lines*
    PM: "Now Y is broken"
    AI: "Ah, I see the issue!" *rewrites 150 lines*
    PM: "OK it works. But..."
    AI: *sweating in tokens*
    PM: "...can we also—"
    AI: "Of course!"  // narrator: it could not
}
```

### Lessons Learned

1. **"It compiles" ≠ "It works"** — But it's a great start when your engineer has no ears
2. **Filter resonance is the QA department** — Crank it up, sweep fast, watch things explode
3. **The AI will always say "Fixed!"** — Statistically, it's right 60% of the time, every time
4. **Lock-free programming is easy** — If you let someone who can't experience race conditions write it
5. **844 tests and counting** — Because when your codebase is written by autocomplete on steroids, trust but verify
6. **The best bug reports are just vibes** — "After a while the arpeggiator produces notes without me pressing any key" → *chef's kiss*
7. **Track deletion requires stopping the world** — Ableton does it too, so it's a feature not a limitation
8. **MIDI Learn is just "wiggle something, click something"** — The AI understood this perfectly on the 4th attempt

*This is what software development looks like in 2026. One human with opinions and one AI with infinite patience. The future is sloppy, it ships, and honestly? It kinda slaps.*
